Description:

  In this assignment, I explored the classification process using text data and ANN classifier and complete the following tasks:
  
  1. Download a dataset according to the description in the next sub-section.
  2. Preprocess the text dataset.
  3. For Chinese text dataset, separate my dataset as training and testing datasets.
  4. Setup topology and hpyerparameters of my ANN classifier.
  5. Train the classifier using the training dataset, and test the classifier using the testing dataset.
  6. Record the classification accuracy for both training dataset and testing dataset.
  7. Find the best settings with highest classification accuracy by altering text preprocessing approach, topology and hyperparameters of ANN, or others. 
     That is, I repeat Steps 2 to 7 and find my best model.
  8. Document my observations or findings using Markdown cell in Jupyter Notebook. 
     For each cell (or cells), I explain the purpose of the codes, and report what  find (observe) after executing the code in Jupyter Notebook.
  9. Make a conclusion section to summarize my work.
