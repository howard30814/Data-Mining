Description:

In this assignment, you will explore the classification process using text data and
ANN classifier and complete the following tasks:
1. Download a dataset according to the description in the next sub-section.
2. Preprocess the text dataset.
3. For Chinese text dataset, separate your dataset as training and testing datasets. For
English text dataset, training and testing datasets are already available.
4. Setup topology and hpyerparameters of your ANN classifier.
5. Train the classifier using the training dataset, and test the classifier using the
testing dataset.
6. Record the classification accuracy for both training dataset and testing dataset.
7. Find the best settings with highest classification accuracy by altering text
preprocessing approach, topology and hyperparameters of ANN, or others. That is,
you want to repeat Steps 2 to 7 and find your best model.
8. Document your observations or findings using Markdown cell in Jupyter
Notebook. For each cell (or cells), you are asked to explain the purpose of the
codes, and report what you find (observe) after executing the code in Jupyter
Notebook.
9. Make a conclusion section to summarize your work.
