Descriptionï¼š

  In this assignment, you will explore classifier decision tree and complete the following tasks:

  1. Download a dataset from UC-Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository.
     (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/) 
  2. Preprocess the dataset. Data preprocessing consists of a broad set of techniques for cleaning, selecting (removing), and transforming data to improve data mining analysis. 
     In data clearing task, I dealed with missing values and outliers if it applied to my case. 
     In transforming task, I transformed nominal and ordinal data to numerical data since decision tree in sklearn package only accepts numerical data.
  3. Separate the dataset to training dataset and testing dataset.
  4. Setup hpyerparameters of my classifiers.
  5. Train the classifiers using the training dataset, and test the classifier using the testing dataset.
  6. Record the classification accuracy for both training dataset and testing dataset. It is suggested to draw the charts for showing my result.
  7. Find the best model with highest classification accuracy by altering preprocessing approach, hyperparameter setting, or others. 
     That is, I repeated Steps 2 to 6 and find the best models. It is suggested that I can apply GridSearchCV for explore the optimal hyperparameter settings.
  8. Document my observations or findings using Markdown cell in Jupyter Notebook. For each cell (or cells), I explained the purpose of the codes, and report what I found (observe) after executing the code in Jupyter Notebook.
  9. Make a conclusion section to summarize my work.
