Description：

Data exploration refers to the preliminary investigation of data in order to better understand its specific characteristics. 

  There are two key motivations for data exploration：
	
    First, to help users select the appropriate preprocessing and data analysis technique used. 
		
    Second, to make use of humans’ abilities to recognize patterns in the data.
		
In this assignment,the following tasks： 

	1.Download a dataset from UC-Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository,and use adult.data for your experiment.
  (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).  
	
	2.Explore your dataset using Python:

  Check data central tendency, variation and spread for each attribute (or important) separately.
	
  Compute the covariance and correlation between pairs of attributes.
	
  Conduct data visualization technique such as box plot or others to explore your data.
